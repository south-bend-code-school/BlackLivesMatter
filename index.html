      Our Black Lives Matter (BLM) app is to help educate the BLM community about what to do when you are in a predicament with the police. In this app we also provide the chance to alert friends or family without having to dial a number, or hurry and send a text, without a cop thinking you have a weapon. We hope to stop some cops from what they are doing and at least bring some peace to the BLM community.
