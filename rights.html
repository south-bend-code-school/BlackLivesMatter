     <h1>Know Your rights</h1>
     <p>In terms of legal ramifications, police officer's may not generally confiscate or demand to view your video without a warrant. They should not under any circumstances ask you to delete your photos or videos. If you feel that your rights have been violated, you and your parents have the right to file a formal complaint with your local police jurisdiction.While you have a right to record the police, police officer's can order citizens to cease activities that are truly interfering with their work. Generally courts differ to an officer's judgment about what "Interfering" means, so if an officer orders you to step back, you should do so.Although citizens have a constitutional right to video tape police officer's performing official duties in public, not all police officer's honor that right. Our advice is to heed the officer's command, even if someone has not committed a crime. It's just not worth the risk. It is always best to remain calm, and certainly never to physically resist a police officer. Always ask the police officer if you can go.If the officer says "Yes", you have the right to remain silent or leave. If the officer says "No" it means you are being detained for questioning. In this instance, you should say "I am goingto remain silent", and request a lawyer. Just because you have the rights in your interactions with the police, and choose to exercise them does not mean that the agents or police will follow the law and respect those rights. Thats why it's advisable to remain calm, polite, and cooperative even when you know they are wrong. Challenging police misconduct should not be done in the street. It's better to do it in the court afterwards. If you believe the police have violated your rights, call your local ACLU affiliate as soon as you can.</p>
